# Monthly Objective - February 2021 - Improve Time Management

## Objective

I will improve my time management skills by:

- planning my week ahead to make sure my OTJ is always at 100%+
- Using my calendar efficiently to make sure I protect my OTJ time

I will demonstrate I have achieved this by reflecting on “what went well/even better if” and uploading this as evidence

## Submission

### Time Bookings

I have blocked time out in my calendar across the period of the apprenticeship and also added in the sessions from the Schedule to ensure the time is already booked out.

### Reflection

Setting the time in the diary is a great way of ensuring you can meet the weekly commitment on time, however there are occasions where priorities mean a reschedule of time. To combat this, I make sure that I rearrange the time I need back later in the week. Ensuring that you start the learning/tasks at the start of the week, means that you do not have to make many changes and you do not have a full amount of time to fill at the end of the week.

The true reflection on this will be in a couple of months to see if the scheduling works and I have been able to meet the requisite times.
