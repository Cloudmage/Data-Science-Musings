# Monthly Objective - February 2021 - Improve Time Management

## Objective

I will improve my time management skills by:

- planning my week ahead to make sure my OTJ is always at 100%+
- Using my calendar efficiently to make sure I protect my OTJ time

I will demonstrate I have achieved this by reflecting on “what went well/even better if” and uploading this as evidence

## Submission

I have blocked time out in my calendar across the period of the apprenticeship and also added in the sessions from the Schedule to ensure the time is already booked out.
