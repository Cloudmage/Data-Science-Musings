# Building an Experimental Mindset

## Overview

Experiments come from the scientific arena.

Observations (Data) --> Hypothesis (Product/Service) --> Scientific Law (Predictive Model)

### Hypothesis Testing Model

#### Hypothesis

Scenario in which your hypothesis is true

#### Null Hypothesis

Scenario in which your hypothesis is false

### A/B Testing

Organisations use Hypothesis Testing using a method called A/B Testing.

#### Scenario A

Product with new features

#### Scenario B

Product with existing features

### Risks of A/B Testing

Data --> Sample --> Study Population --> Target Population

- Segmentation
- World Time Zones
- Target Population
- Privacy/Data Laws
