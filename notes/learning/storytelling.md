# Storytelling

## What is data's role in a story

When we use data we tell stories around it to explain what it is telling us.

## Powers of Persuasion

Aristotle's Power of Persuasion

- Ethos - Author/Speaker (Character, Credibility, Authority, Truthfulness)
- Pathos - This topic effects you - connect and bridge the gap (Current emotional state, Target emotional estate)
- Logos - This is why it effects you - story/proposal (Reasonablenss, Consistancy, Clarity)
- Karios - Timing

### Ethos

‘It is not true, as some writers assume in their treatises on rhetoric, that the personal goodness revealed by the speaker contributes nothing to his power of persuasion; on the contrary, his character may almost be called the most effective means of persuasion he possesses.’ — Rhetoric, Aristotle

### Pathos

‘persuasion is effected through the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.’ — Rhetoric, Aristotle

### Logos

‘persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech stirs their emotions. Our judgements when we are pleased and friendly are not the same as when we are pained and hostile.’ — Rhetoric, Aristotle

### Karios

is an Ancient Greek word meaning the right, critical, or opportune moment

## Monroe's Motivated Sequence

Monroe's motivated sequence states that on the first step is to state the problem the customer is having, then explain it if one cannot solidify the need and give a representation of the situation that may occur.

**Attention** - The attention step is audience-focused and uses an attention-getter to catch the audience's attention.

**Need** - The topic is applied to the psychological needs of the audience members. Monroe believed that it was most effective to convince the audience that they had specific needs tailored to the topic of the presentation.

**Satisfaction** - Specific and viable solutions to the problems raised in the previous step are presented to the audience.

**Visualization** - The solution is then described in such a way that the audience can visualize both the solution and its positive effects in a detailed manner.

**Action** - The audience is then told how to solve the problem using the solution(s) previously presented
