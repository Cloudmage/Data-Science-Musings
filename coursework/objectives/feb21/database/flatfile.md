# Database Structure - Flat File

An example of a flat file is a text file containing CSV (Comma Seperate Variables) data.

A Flat File database structure is data stored in a file which contains information in a uniform format but does not have any indexing or structure. A Flat File cannot recognise any relationships between records, athough relationships could be inferred from the data in the file.

Data can be stored in a table.
