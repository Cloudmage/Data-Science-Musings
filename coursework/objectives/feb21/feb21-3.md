# Research Different Data Structures

## Objective

### Actions

- Research different data structures (e.g., flat, relational, hierarchical, network, object-oriented,...) and make notes on their pros and cons (both in terms of getting data into this structure, and then using data structured in this way for analysis) and use cases.
- Decide for your specific problem which structure is most suitable and how to get your data into that structure.
- Evaluate how easy and useful this process was for preparing your data for analysis.

### Evidence

- Notes made (see below)

#### Data Structures

Data is stored in a data structure in order to allow different operations to be carried out against it, such a query or data manipulation. How data is stored in a data structure depends upon the structure it is stored in.

Understanding the different structures allow you to write more efficient and optimal code.

Data structure are typically static/immutable (not allowing change) or mutable (allowing changes to take place).

Data Structures are different to Database Models

#### Data Structure Types

Here are some of the types of Data Structures

- [Array](/data/datastructure/array.md)
- [Binary Tree](/data/datastructure/binarytree.md)
- [Linked List](/data/datastructure/linkedlist.md)
- [Stack](/data/datastructure/stack.md)
- [Queue](/data/datastructure/queue.md)
- [Heap](/data/datastructure/heap.md)
- [Hash Table](/data/datastructure/hashtable.md)

#### Database Model/Structure Types

Here are some of the types of Database Models

- [Flat File](/data/database/flatfile.md)
- [Relational](/data/database/relational.md)
- [Hierarchical](/data/database/hierarchical.md)
- [Network](/data/database/network.md)
- [Object-Oriented](/data/database/objecto.md)
