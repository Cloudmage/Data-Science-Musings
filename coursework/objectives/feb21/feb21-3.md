# Research Different Data Structures

## Objective

### Actions

- Research different data structures (e.g., flat, relational, hierarchical, network, object-oriented,...) and make notes on their pros and cons (both in terms of getting data into this structure, and then using data structured in this way for analysis) and use cases.
- Decide for your specific problem which structure is most suitable and how to get your data into that structure.
- Evaluate how easy and useful this process was for preparing your data for analysis.

### Evidence

- Notes made.

### Data Structures

Data is stored in a data structure in order to allow different operations to be carried out against it, such a query or data manipulation. How data is stored in a data structure depends upon the structure it is stored in.

Understanding the different structures allow you to write more efficient and optimal code.

Data structure are typically static/immutable (not allowing change) or mutable (allowing changes to take place).

### Data Structure Types

Here are some of the types of data structures

- [Array](datastructure/array.md)
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Heap
- Hash Table
